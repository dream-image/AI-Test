[2026-02-03T21:59:56.405+08:00] response content: <thought>The user instruction is to type "AI 101" and hit Enter. Based on the screenshot, there is a search bar at the top right of the page with a magnifying glass icon, which appears to be the search input field. The next logical step is to click on this search bar to focus it, then type "AI 101", and finally press Enter. Since the task is explicit and requires only these actions, I will proceed with clicking the search bar first.</thought>
